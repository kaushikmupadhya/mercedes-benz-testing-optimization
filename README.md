# Mercedes-Benz Testing Optimization

## Overview
This repository contains the solution to a Kaggle problem focused on optimizing the testing time for Mercedes-Benz cars. The challenge involves predicting the time cars spend on the test bench based on different feature permutations, with the goal of reducing overall testing time while maintaining Mercedes-Benz’s high safety and performance standards.

## Problem Statement
As one of the world’s largest manufacturers of premium cars, Mercedes-Benz requires efficient and robust testing systems to ensure safety and reliability. However, the current testing process is complex and time-consuming due to the numerous feature combinations available for customization. In this challenge, we aim to develop machine learning models that reduce the time spent on testing, thereby increasing production efficiency and reducing carbon emissions.

## Dataset
The dataset contains feature combinations for various Mercedes-Benz car configurations and the corresponding testing time. By analyzing this data, we can predict how long a car will spend on the test bench.

**Context:**
Mercedes-Benz applies for nearly 2000 patents annually and has been a leader in automotive innovation since the invention of the Benz Patent Motor Car in 1886. With numerous safety features, intelligent systems, and customization options, the company must optimize the testing time for these configurations to maintain efficiency.

**Inspiration:**
Faster testing times can lead to reduced carbon dioxide emissions and greater production efficiency, without compromising on quality and safety.
